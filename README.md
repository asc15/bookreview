#bookreviewpoint
A simple website where one can give reviews about a particular book.
It uses html,css,flask, heroku postgres database for its functionality.
Users will be able to register for my website and then log in using their email and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for
books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. I also used
the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader
audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via
my websiteâ€™s API.
